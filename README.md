# Project Description

This project is part of the road traffic context and allows for the completion of the friendly road accident declaration.
This tool was designed to make this task more comfortable, faster, so that those involved in the accident can streamline the entire process.
The project developed is a WebApp, which allows the user to fill in an easy-to-use automobile accident declaration.
Its operation is very intuitive, entering the data for a user record, and the respective vehicle. You can enter the user's vehicle in advance so that, when filling it out, it is only necessary to select the vehicle that was present in the claim, attach photos and fully define the occurrence, so that later all information is sent by email to the intervening parties to verify the veracity of the information entered to be sent to the insurer.
To ensure veracity, a system was created that works with a token, where it is generated and sent to stakeholders. So that the user can only send security information if this token is provided, this way it is possible to guarantee that no irregularities are transmitted to legal entities.
In addition to the choices, another focus of the project is the fact that it is possible to save a photo of the occurrence on the device, sent both to the intervening parties and to the insurance company.
At the end of filling in, all the data of the parties involved in the claim are deleted from the database so that no sensitive data is saved and subsequently accessed.
